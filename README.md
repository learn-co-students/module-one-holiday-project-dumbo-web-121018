# Mood Quiz

Mood quiz is an app that has you select between two quotes until you reach the end, at which point your sentiment score can be accessed from the menu. This app relies on quotes scraped from GoodReads.com, and on Google's Sentiment Analysis API. 

### Menu Options

1. Take the quiz -- take the quiz to see which mood of quotes you prefer
2. See author moods -- based on the quotes in this app, see what kind of mood each author has
3. See my overall mood -- see the combined results of each time you've taken the quiz
4. See my mood by date -- see the results for any one day on which you've taken the quiz
5. Add quote -- add a quote for any of the authors existing in the database
6. Logout

### Issues

Due to a warning on my project from Google, the Add quote function is not working. This is because sentiment analysis is performed automatically on any added quote. At present attempting to add a quote will exit the program with an error. I am waiting on Google to reinstate my app.
